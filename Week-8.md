This week's pratical is to build a suitable website for the assessment. So, I learn how to write more about php code and functions from videos and websites. Then, I changed some of the codes which are shown by the lecturer and added more suitable ones to make basic for this week. On this website, I complete all the min-tesk such as Echo, Decisions, Repetition, Functions and Include.
