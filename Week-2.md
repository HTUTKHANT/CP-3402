# Estimated Hours

About 10 hours, Because I don't know how to use Joomla. I usually use Xampp and sublime text for building websites.

# Content Insights

Watch are the most can change a person to be smart and good-looking. It can also make people up-standard.
So, I chose to make a watch online shop. First, I choose the type of business that I want to build.
I compare all of the luxury brands. Then, I compare the website that I want to build.
I chose SQUARESAPCE and SITEGROUND. After that, I compare them again. But the best one is the Siteground.
Because it is already recommended by the course and it is so easy to use. And I do some research on online projects.
As I chose online shopping, I added some pages but most of them need more detailed functions.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After finishing the practical, I will do reflections, add more detailed functions, and do iteration.
I will look into some textbooks about the upcoming week, do better for the website, and update it again.
