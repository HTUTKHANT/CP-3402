# Learning and Activity Resources

This week, we have to create a group for assessment 2, which is a big CMS project. So, we create a team with four members.
Then, we chose 1 platform for communication; which is Slack and it was recommended by the lecturer. Then we create team repository and team backlog places which we have to do in later weeks.

This week's pratical is to build a suitable website for the assessment. So, I learn how to write more about php code and functions from videos and websites.
