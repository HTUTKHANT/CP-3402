# Learning and Activity Resources

This week, we have to create a group for assessment 2, which is a big CMS project. So, we create a team with four members.
Then, we chose 1 platform for communication; which is Slack and it was recommended by the lecturer. Then we create team repository and team backlog places which we have to do in later weeks.
