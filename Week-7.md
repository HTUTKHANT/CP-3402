# Learning and Activity Resources

This week, we have to create a group for assessment 2, which is a big CMS project. So, we create a team with four members.
Then, we chose 1 platform for communication; which is Slack and it was recommended by the lecturer. Then we create team repository and team backlog places which we have to do in later weeks.

# Estimated Hours

Estimated more than 3 hours.

# Content Insights

This week's pratical is to build a suitable website for the assessment. So, I learn how to write more about php code and functions from videos and websites. Then, I changed some of the codes which are shown by the lecturer and added more suitable ones to make basic for this week. On this website, I complete all the min-tesk such as Echo, Decisions, Repetition, Functions and Include.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In later weeks, we need to add more photos, videos and make a complete website for the assessment.
