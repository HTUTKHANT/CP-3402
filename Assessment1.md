Name: HTUT KHANT WON


Student ID: 14486908


Type of system - Sale of private land to do farming and gardening.


## Learning Journey for Assignment 1

This assessment is to create 2 websites for the business that hasn't been in the real world by using two CMS system applications.
So, in this assessment, I chose 1 to use Joomla and 1 to choose WordPress.

### Learning Journey

#### Learning Activities & Resources

After creating the Joomla website, I had to research the WordPress website. The assessment also has limits. So, I have to research them carefully.
I found many videos but most of them won't satisfy me. So, I try to watch videos on YouTube and search for some documents about WordPress.

#### Estimated hours

I nearly spend 2 days to complete this assessment. This is my first time using WordPress. So, WordPress takes more than a day to do.
I nearly took 2 hours to make documentation and  6 hours to make Joomla. Approximately 16 hours are spent thinking about the system which can make the users to better.

#### Content Insights 

This website aims to sell a place that can do farming and gardening with the person they love and spend far away from the city place.
The place is complete with nature. So, it will make the customer comfortable.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

By creating this website, I i think need more things to learn for various CMS systems. Right now, I can create some of them but they are not perfect.
I can create more on the Joomla website. Because of pratical that have to do in last week. There are also many plugs and many tools that I haven't used.
Each of the CMS applications has advantages and disadvantages. So, I need to calculate the outcome and better prepare for assessment 2.
