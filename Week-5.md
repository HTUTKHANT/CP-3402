Cus color can change much but they cannot use for a long term but the padding, fount and some other such as radius can be use more in later. So, i change most of them in here.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I think I need more time. I added some connection with data bes but it is on the website. So, I can't add files here. 
I do more self-learning. but the teacher didn't show the way. So, I satisfy some basic needs in this project.
After finishing the practical, I will do reflections, add more detailed functions, and do iteration.
I will look into some textbooks about the upcoming week, do better for the website, and update it again.
