# Content Insights

This week's pratical is to install a WordPress website which we have to build more in next week. All I have to do is to follow the video show. So, there aren't any errors are difficulties.
I already know how to use xampp, how to use localhost, how to build the database from localhost and I also know to to use WordPress; because of last week.
