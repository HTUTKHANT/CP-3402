# Learning and Activity Resources

This week, I set up the new website about assessment 1 by using WordPress. As WordPress is my first time using it don't create perfectly in Assessment. So, I will do some minours in this week.

I watched 1 video successfully and researched my Assessment 1 website that I have done.

 The up one is about the video that I watched.

# Estimated Hours

About 10 hours, Because I don't know how to use WordPress. I usually use Xampp and sublime text for building websites and I have already done Joomla which is another CMS. I do a liitle in Assessment1 but it is not perfect one.

# Content Insights

This week's practical is to use a Website which can also be used as a CMS(Content Management System). So, I created a website that is nearly as same reason as my assessment-1 website but this time using WordPress.
WordPress is my second time using it. So, I was unsatisfied and many errors. But I created a website that can be used by all of the people.
I added some functions such as adding pictures and showing some incredible pictures. I use some slide functions and set up some more in other taps.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I think I need more time. I added some connection with data bes but it is on the website. So, I can't add files here. 
I do more self-learning. but the teacher didn't show the way. So, I satisfy some basic needs in this project.
After finishing the practical, I will do reflections, add more detailed functions, and do iteration.
I will look into some textbooks about the upcoming week, do better for the website, and update it again.
