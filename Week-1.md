#Learning and Activity Resources
This week I set up a website about online shopping. That is a watch shop.
I learn most of the time by watching videos on YouTube and researching some online pages and ChatGPT.
The video below is one of the videos that I fully watched to learn the basics about Siteground.

#Estimated Hours
About 6 hours, Because I don't know how to use GitHub.
I got exceptions in Programming 1, 2 and 3. And this is my first-time use of all of the websites.

#Content Insights
Watch are the most can change a person to be smart and good-looking. It can also make people up-standard.
So, I chose to make a watch online shop. First, I choose the type of business that I want to build.
I compare all of the luxury brands. Then, I compare the website that I want to build.
I chose SQUARESAPCE and SITEGROUND. After that, I compare them again. But the best one is the Siteground.
Because it is already recommended by the course and it is so easy to use. And I do some research on online projects.
As I chose online shopping, I added some pages but most of them need more detailed functions.

#Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After finishing the practical, I will do reflections, add more detailed functions, and do iteration.
I will look into some textbooks about the upcoming week, do better for the website, and update it again.
